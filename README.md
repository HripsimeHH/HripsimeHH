- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know the earliest version of JavaScript was called Mocha? The original name, coined by its creator, Brendan Eich, at Netscape in May 1995, was inspired by a coffee-like coding style.
The second time, it was briefly renamed LiveScript for its beta version in Netscape 2.0 in September 1995.
Roughly after 2 months, the official name changed to JavaScript for the final release of Netscape 2.0B3 in December 1995.
This was due to a strategic partnership between Netscape and Sun Microsystems, which wanted to capitalize on the popularity of Java.
